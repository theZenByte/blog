I do not believe that there is free will. Why are so many deeply offended and disheartened by this? Hearing this is a shatter to the ego.

Free will provides a shelter for ego, for a worldview of a super autonomous individual. “The world doesn’t shape me; I shape the world,” it’s clinged onto for this purpose. It doesn’t matter if free will, or a world view like this makes any logical sense or not. That’s not the point; the point is, this worldview creates hope, and purpose in the minds of many. So of course, when you introduce an idea that contradicts that it can be devastating. 

Maybe, there is another way to view things. Maybe there’s a beauty in knowing that we are part of something larger. Maybe you can find peace in accepting that you are part of the process and not the process itself. Maybe you can give compassion to what others are going through. Maybe you don’t need all this imaginary power to be valued or to be valuable to others. Maybe ego is the problem. 

As a rule of thumb, if an idea offends you, it is because it contradicts a worldview you have. That doesn’t mean that it’s wrong or evil, it probably means that you should explore the idea more.
