Some nights ago, I decided to tune everything out — if only for a second — to reflect on why I’ve turned out the way I am. Perhaps we all need moments like this, not for ego, but for deeper understanding and compassion — for our own sake and for others’. I realized that, more than anything in my life, what I’ve always strived for is a sense of peace and stability — boring, I know. But there might be something here, something that resonates, so I wanted to share it.

Without diving too deep into my own psychology, we can all see the trend — the rise of distrust, chaos, and instability in America. I could bring up divorce rates, or the growing distrust in religion, science, government — you name the institution — and people aren’t sure they can trust it anymore. Where are today’s young people supposed to look for peace and stability? Why are they so anxious? (The plethora of conflicting narratives, facts, etc. on the internet plays a part here)

Well, I guess I just have to find that in myself. Maybe that’s why there’s such a big self-help movement among Gen Z, and such a strong urge to be successful. If I can’t trust anyone else, then I can only trust myself. I can’t control all these factors I can only control myself. Hopefully even a select few strong and bright minded individuals can rebuild or crumbling trust and provide peace and stability to the next generation. Possibly through great political change and triumph or by simply finding true peace and stability within yourself.
